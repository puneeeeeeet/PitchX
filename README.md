# Project Overview

This is a responsive web application designed to showcase a feed of skill-based user posts. It provides a clean and visually appealing interface for users to browse various types of achievements, such as projects, certifications, coding ranks, research papers, and internships. The application also includes a sidebar featuring a user dashboard, a leaderboard, and sections for top projects and skills, along with sorting and filtering capabilities for the main feed. This project serves as a front-end demonstration, utilizing dummy data for all content.

## Tech Stack Used
